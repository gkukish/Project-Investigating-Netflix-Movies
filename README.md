# Investigating Netflix Movies
### Description 
Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service  
exploded prominently as the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, 
boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021.
Given the many movies and series on the platform, 
it is a perfect opportunity to use data manipulation skills and 
dive into the entertainment industry. I use a CSV file containing data about 
Netflix movies and will perform 
some analyses on them to see if the average duration of the film has decreased over time.
